## Before Installing
Before installing the dxdd folder, please temporarily disable your antivirus software, as it may mistakenly flag the file inside the folder as malicious. If you have any doubts about the fileâ€™s safety, you can verify it by scanning it on VirusTotal or open it in a VirtualMachine.

## Steps

Here are the steps for installation:

- Go to the GitHub releases page.
- Under the assets section, find and download dxdd.zip.
- Extract and run the dxdd.exe file.

After, open the software and open gorilla tag and type `inject --1` or choose any option from 1 to 5 and press Enter. Each cheat option is numbered for your convenience. You'll see a small success message appear in the top left corner and the option chosen will have a green text that will say True, indicating that you're all set!
